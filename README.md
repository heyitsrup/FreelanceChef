# FreelanceChef
App can be used by both employees and employers.
Organisation can upload a job listing which requires chef.
Depending on urgency, associated price will be assigned to listing.
Employees see these listings, can bid on their future payment.
  For example, if the listing is originally Â£100, a chef may apply saying they'll do it for less.
  Thus up to organisation to hire cheaper vs. more experienced candidates.
  Up to freelancers to know their realistic value.
Once job is confirmed, organisation pays designated amount.
This money is kept in limbo until organisation confirms freelancer
